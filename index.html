         <h4>LEGO plans to find replacement material for bricks by 2030</h4>
            <img src="download.jfif" class="image-reponsive col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <p class="list-group-item list-group-item-success col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp.

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.

In 2015, they established the LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre in order to research other options for its product and packaging.

“There is no common definition of a sustainable material. Several factors influence the environmental sustainability of a material – the composition of the material, how it is sourced and what happens when the product reaches the end of its life. When we search for new materials all of these factors must be considered,” said Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, CEO and President of the LEGO Group.

One material that has been floated as a possible alternative has been hemp. 420 Magazine motivated in their article that hemp could be a good option to replace the plastic material currently used. Hemp is a cannabis plant with very low levels of THC and is mostly used for its fiber and seeds. These can be processed into biodegradable plastic material. This is because of it’s high cellulose content, which is great for making plastics.

While LEGO have not commented on hemp as a possible solution, they did bring out a line of bricks make from sugarcane plastic in 2018. While reducing the use of plastics, these blocks are still not biodegradable.

         <h4>Amazon deforestation and number of fires show summer of 2019 not a 'normal' year</h4>
            <img src="download%20(1).jfif" class="image-reponsive col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <p class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">The fires that raged across the Brazilian Amazon this summer were not 'normal' and large increases in deforestation could explain why, scientists show.

The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.

An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.

Although fires in the Amazon can occur in a number of ways, the scientists show that there is strong evidence to link this year's increases to deforestation.

They have used evidence collected from the Brazilian Government's DETER-b deforestation detection system—which calculates deforestation by interpreting images taken by NASA satellites.

This shows that deforestation in July this year was almost four times the average from the same period in the previous three years. This is important as deforestation is almost always followed by fire—the cut vegetation is left to dry before being burned.
